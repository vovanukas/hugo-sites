## Installation

### Install as Hugo Module

The recommended way to install **Lóng Téng** is via Hugo Modules.

#### Step 1: Initialize Hugo Modules
If you haven't already, initialize Hugo modules in your project:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/your/repo
```

#### Step 2: Update `config.toml`
Add the theme as a module in your configuration file:

```toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/mdfriday/theme-long-teng"
```

#### Step 3: Load and Run
Download the module and run your site:

```bash
hugo mod get -u
hugo server --minify
```

## Versioning

This theme follows a simple incremental versioning. e.g. `v1`, `v2` and so on. There might be breaking changes between versions.

If you want lower maintenance, use one of the released versions. If you want to live on the bleeding edge of changes, you can use the `main` branch and update your website when needed.
